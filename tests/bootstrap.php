/**
 * One test file, inside WordPress (run.php runs `wp eval-file bootstrap.php
 * <test file>`): the database in a transaction rolled back at the end, mail
 * not sent, an administrator as the current user, and the helpers below.
 *
 * Every table is InnoDB, and the site has no persistent object cache: a
 * rollback leaves the database as it was. What WordPress wrote while it
 * started, before this file runs (a language's term the plugin creates, a
 * cron run), isn't in the transaction. Cache Tags' purges have no listener:
 * a test that checks them adds its own. What a test writes on disk (the
 * static cache's copy, uploads) isn't rolled back: a test that writes files
 * removes them itself.
 *
 * The helpers:
 *
 *   check('what is checked', $condition)        a check, passed or failed
 *   same($expected, $actual, 'what')            the two equal (===), the difference shown when not
 *   section('a heading')                        a line in the output
 *   restore_purges()                            Cache Tags' purges reach their adapters again
 *
 * A check that fails doesn't stop the file; an exception or a fatal error
 * does, and the file is reported as not finished.
